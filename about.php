                        <h3>Everything started with comics</h3> 
                        <p>As first i did not know nothing about computers or software, i just like to draw comics in my note books when i was in the school as a little child, i started drawing my own pokemons, ending drawing like more than four hundred pokemons completly uniques and with evolutions, some with 4 evolutions, if Gamefreak will hire my as child i would make a completly generation of pokemons.</p>
                        <p>I was very exicted to have a computer and make comics on it, but when i got my first computer and saw how paints works and not having to much skills on doing anything, i was almost no able to doing nothing more than getting impressive for having that piece of technology on my room, a white big ass monitor with that windows 95 software on it.</p>
                        <p>So the first thing i was able to make on it was just play windows 95 games, childs dont do nothing productive on computers, and even less without internet.</p>
